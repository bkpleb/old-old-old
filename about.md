Some 17 y/o based in Australia who's an aspiring polymath, explorer, realist, and systems thinker. I stand on the shoulder of giants.

In the past, I've:

- Worked on blockchain fraud intel cases (OSINT) at [Lionsgate Network](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lionsgate-network)
- Edited [content](https://pessimistic.io/slitherin) on static analysis for [Pessimistic Security](https://pessimistic.io/)
- Wrote and managed content at [Market Mapper](https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/marketmapper) (rip)
- Edited, wrote and maintained [offical documentation](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/user/VintageMind/documents)for Firefox, moderated community, and drove volunteer participation for initiatives at [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org/)
- Coded trivial stuff at [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)

Iâ€™m passionate about privacy-focused technologies.
Other interests of mine include UAS, infosec, computational finance, and political science.</p>
Remember, everything is a system.
